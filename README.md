# **MCA CORPORATE DATA MANAGEMENT SCHEME: REVIEW & IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSAL**

**Submitted by:** PwC India  
**Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Project Duration:** 26-30 weeks

***

## **PAGE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & APPROACH**

### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has opened the Corporate Data Management (CDM) scheme for review and third-party implementation. This proposal outlines our practical approach to transform MCA21 filing data into usable, compliant, and commercially sustainable data products.

Our work focuses on three core goals:

1. Make CDM data easier to extract and use (reduce manual work, improve accuracy)
2. Create compliant data products that generate revenue for the Ministry
3. Build a system MCA staff can operate independently after handover

We start with a working pilot for one filing type, prove it works, then scale to others. Every recommendation comes with measured results—not assumptions.

***

### **OUR APPROACH**

We follow a straightforward process for each RFP requirement—assessment, diagnostic, data transformation, stakeholder feedback, governance, privacy review, and monetization.

The cycle is simple:
- **Gather evidence:** Study current reality with actual data samples
- **Build a pilot:** Create working solutions we can test
- **Verify results:** Measure what works and what doesn't
- **Provide recommendations:** Give MCA clear next steps with cost estimates

This directly covers all Scope-of-Work items mentioned in the RFP. We avoid theoretical surveys and focus on what can be built and measured within the project timeline.

**Project alignment to RFP scope:** Assessment (Week 3-6), Diagnostic (Week 3-6), Data Transformation (Week 7-12), Stakeholder Feedback (Week 5-6), Governance Setup (Week 7-12), DPIA Completion (Week 9-12), Monetization Pilots (Week 13-22), Scalability Roadmap (Week 23-26).

***

### **WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS**

Most CDM studies produce reports that sit on shelves. We produce working systems with measured outcomes:

- Extraction accuracy percentages (target: 90%+)
- QC workload reduction (target: 60%+ less manual checking)
- Processing speed (target: hours instead of weeks)
- Revenue potential from data products (conservative estimates)

These numbers help MCA make informed decisions about budget and scale-up.

***

## **PAGE 2: DISCOVERY & DIAGNOSTIC PHASE**

### **UNDERSTANDING CURRENT STATE**

We start by understanding how CDM fits within MCA21 today. Discovery covers two areas:

**Technical Reality**

MCA21 filings come in different formats:
- **XML files:** Structured data, easier to extract (example: balance sheets in XBRL format)
- **PDF documents:** Mix of machine-readable and scanned images
- **Excel sheets:** Semi-structured, need validation

We don't assume what works. Instead, we take a sample of high-value filing types (around 100 filings) and run actual extraction tests. We measure:

- Extraction coverage percentage (how many fields can we pull automatically?)
- Per-field accuracy rates (how often is extracted data correct?)
- Error patterns (what types of mistakes happen most?)
- QC workload estimates (how much human review is still needed?)

These numbers tell us which filing types are ready for automation and which need more work.¹

**User Demand Reality**

Different groups need different things from CDM:

- **Policy units** (like IEPFA, SFIO): Want aggregated trends for policy analysis
- **Enforcement teams:** Need quick access to specific company filings for investigations
- **Research institutions:** Want historical datasets for academic studies
- **Commercial users** (credit bureaus, analytics firms): Need API access for business use

We conduct 6-10 targeted consultations with these groups. A short survey helps us understand:
- Top use-cases for each group
- Current pain-points with existing CDM access
- What "value delivered" means for different users

This ensures our diagnostic isn't just technically sound—it matches what actual users need.²

***

### **DISCOVERY OUTPUT**

The discovery phase produces a clear action list:

1. **Which filing types to prioritize** (based on extraction feasibility + user demand)
2. **What success looks like** (specific accuracy and speed targets)
3. **Minimal governance checks needed** (before any data can be shared or sold)

This becomes the blueprint for the pilot phase.

**Example priority matrix:**

| Filing Type | Extraction Feasibility | User Demand | Priority Rank |
|------------|----------------------|------------|--------------|
| AOC-4 (Financial Statements) | High (XML available) | High (enforcement + commercial) | 1 |
| MGT-7 (Annual Return) | Medium (mix of formats) | High (research + policy) | 2 |
| DIR-3 (Director KYC) | Low (PDF-heavy) | Medium | 5 |

***

### **TIMELINE: WEEKS 3-6**

- Week 3-4: Technical diagnostic (filing analysis, extraction tests)
- Week 5: Stakeholder consultations and workshops
- Week 6: Discovery synthesis and pilot scope finalization

**Team:** Data scientists (2), Business analyst (1), Domain expert (1), Project manager (1)

***

## **PAGE 3: PILOT EXTRACTION & VALIDATION**

### **BUILDING THE PILOT**

We pick one high-impact filing type to prove the concept. For this example, let's say AOC-4 financial statements.

The pilot shows the complete process end-to-end:

**Step 1: Secure Data Intake**

Files come from MCA21 staging environment. We set up secure access controls (only authorized team members can view raw data).

**Step 2: Automated Parsing**

- **For XML filings:** Direct field extraction (company name, CIN, balance sheet figures)
- **For PDF filings:** OCR + NLP to read scanned documents
- **For Excel sheets:** Template-based extraction with validation

We use Azure Document Intelligence and similar tools for OCR. The system isn't perfect—it flags low-confidence extractions for human review.

**Step 3: Validation Checks**

Every extracted field goes through validation:
- Format checks (is this actually a CIN? does it match the expected pattern?)
- Business logic (do assets equal liabilities + equity?)
- Cross-reference checks (does the company name match MCA master registry?)

Records that fail validation get flagged for manual review.

**Step 4: Data Standardization**

We map extracted data to a common format (canonical schema). This makes it easier to combine data from different filing types later.

**Step 5: Exposure Layer**

The processed data becomes available through:
- **Two dashboards:** One for policy analysts (shows trends across companies), one for enforcement teams (drill-down to specific filings)
- **Simple API:** Five core endpoints for programmatic access (search company, get filing data, download PDF, etc.)

***

### **SUCCESS METRICS**

We set clear targets upfront:

| Metric | Target | How We Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Extraction accuracy (numeric fields) | ≥ 90% | Compare extracted values vs. manual verification (sample of 100 filings) |
| XML parsing success | ≥ 95% | Count successful parses / total XML files |
| PDF OCR accuracy | ≥ 85% | Character-level accuracy check |
| Processing speed | ≤ 4 hours | Time from file receipt to searchable in dashboard |

We only proceed to scaling if these targets are met. This reduces risk—MCA sees working proof before committing to full rollout.³

***

### **PRACTICAL AI USE**

We don't try to automate everything immediately. Instead, we combine AI-assisted extraction with human verification.

**Active learning approach:**
- System flags uncertain extractions (confidence score < 80%)
- Human reviewer corrects flagged items
- System learns from corrections and improves over time

This cuts manual workload by 60-70% while maintaining quality. All extraction templates are documented and version-controlled for future audits.

**Entity linking across filings:**

We also use graph techniques to link companies across different filing types. For example:
- Company X submitted AOC-4 (financial statement) in June 2024
- Same company submitted MGT-7 (annual return) in August 2024
- System links both filings to Company X's profile

This helps track companies over time—useful for policy analysis, fraud detection, and research.⁴

***

### **TIMELINE: WEEKS 7-12**

- Week 7: Data pipeline development (ingestion, parsing)
- Week 8-9: Validation engine and quality checks
- Week 10: Dashboard and API development
- Week 11: Integration testing and security hardening
- Week 12: User acceptance testing and final approval

**Team:** Data engineers (3), ML engineer (1), Backend developer (1), Frontend developer (2), QA tester (2)

***

## **PAGE 4: GOVERNANCE, PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE**

### **LEGAL REQUIREMENTS**

Before any CDM data can be shared or sold, we need to complete privacy and governance checks. This aligns with:
- Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act
- National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP)
- MCA Act requirements

This work happens in parallel with pilot building (Weeks 7-12).

***

### **DATA CLASSIFICATION**

We review every data field in MCA21 filings and classify them:

**Category 1: Public Data**
- Company name, CIN, registration date
- Registered office address
- Authorized capital
- **Access:** Can be shared freely

**Category 2: Sensitive Personal Data**
- Director PAN, DIN, personal addresses
- Shareholder details
- **Access:** Must be masked or removed before sharing

**Category 3: Confidential Business Data**
- Detailed financial figures (below certain thresholds)
- Related party transactions
- **Access:** Aggregated only, no individual company details

This classification drives masking rules and access controls.⁵

***

### **PRIVACY ASSESSMENT (DPIA)**

We conduct a formal Data Protection Impact Assessment:

**Risk Assessment:**
- What personal data is collected?
- Who has access to it?
- What could go wrong if data leaks or is misused?

**Mitigation Controls:**
- Anonymization/masking for sensitive fields
- Role-based access controls (policy teams see aggregates, enforcement sees individual records)
- Audit logging (track who accessed what data, when)

**DPIA deliverable:** A signed document from the Data Protection Officer confirming risks are acceptable and controls are in place.

***

### **ACCESS TIERS**

We define three access levels for CDM data products:

**Tier 1: Public Access**
- Aggregated statistics and trends
- No individual company identification
- Free or low-cost access

**Tier 2: Research Access**
- Anonymized datasets for academic use
- Company names visible but sensitive fields masked
- Free for government-approved institutions, nominal fee for others

**Tier 3: Commercial Access**
- Full field-level data (with compliant masking)
- Real-time API access
- Subscription-based pricing for credit bureaus, analytics firms

Only filing types that pass both quality tests and legal reviews move to commercial tier.

***

### **COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION**

**Governance Rulebook:**
- Who can access what data?
- How is data masked/anonymized?
- What approvals are needed before sharing?
- How are violations handled?

**Data Sharing Agreement Templates:**
- Standard contracts for research institutions
- Standard contracts for commercial users
- Terms of service for API access

These documents protect MCA from future audit issues and legal challenges.⁶

***

### **TIMELINE: WEEKS 7-12 (PARALLEL TRACK)**

- Week 7-8: Data classification and legal review
- Week 9-10: DPIA and risk assessment
- Week 11-12: Governance rulebook drafting and DPO sign-off

**Team:** Legal counsel (1), Data Protection Officer (1), Security analyst (0.5)

***

## **PAGE 5: MONETIZATION & SCALING**

### **DATA PRODUCTS STRATEGY**

Once the pilot works and governance is approved, we create actual products people can use.

**Product 1: Research Datasets**

**Target users:** Academic researchers, think tanks, government policy units

**What they get:**
- Anonymized bulk datasets (CSV/Excel format)
- 3-5 years of historical filings
- Data dictionary and field definitions

**Pricing:**
- Free for government-approved institutions
- ₹50,000-1,00,000 per dataset for private research firms

**Pilot approach:** Partner with 2 academic institutions (IIM, ISB) to test usefulness and gather feedback.

***

**Product 2: Policy Dashboards**

**Target users:** MCA policy units, enforcement divisions

**What they get:**
- Pre-built dashboards showing trends (filings by state, sector-wise capital trends, compliance rates)
- Drill-down capability to see individual companies
- Export to Excel for further analysis

**Pricing:** Internal use (no charge to MCA), or offered as white-label service to other ministries

**Pilot approach:** Deploy for IEPFA and SFIO teams first, refine based on usage patterns.

***

**Product 3: Commercial APIs**

**Target users:** Credit bureaus, analytics firms, fintech companies

**What they get:**
- Real-time API access to filing data
- Five core endpoints (search company, get financial data, download PDF, check compliance status, get director details)
- API documentation and code samples

**Pricing:**
- ₹2,00,000-5,00,000 annual subscription (SME tier, up to 10,000 API calls/month)
- ₹10,00,000-25,00,000 annual subscription (Enterprise tier, unlimited calls)

**Pilot approach:** Test with 2 commercial partners (one credit bureau, one analytics firm) for 3 months. Measure API usage, error rates, and customer satisfaction.

***

### **REVENUE FORECASTS (CONSERVATIVE)**

We base estimates on India's data monetization market studies:⁷

**Year 1 (Pilot Phase):**
- Research datasets: ₹10-15 lakhs
- Commercial API pilots: ₹20-30 lakhs
- **Total:** ₹30-45 lakhs

**Year 2 (Scale-Up):**
- Research datasets (10 filing types): ₹50-75 lakhs
- Commercial APIs (50 paying customers): ₹2-3 crores
- **Total:** ₹2.5-3.75 crores

**Year 3 (Mature State):**
- Research + Policy products: ₹1 crore
- Commercial APIs (150 paying customers): ₹8-12 crores
- **Total:** ₹9-13 crores

These are conservative estimates. Actual revenue depends on product-market fit and marketing efforts.

***

### **SCALING APPROACH**

We don't build everything at once. Instead, we create reusable templates:

**Pipeline Template:**
Once AOC-4 pilot works, we document:
- What code/tools were used?
- What worked well and what didn't?
- How much time/cost per filing?

This template gets reused for the next filing type (with minor adjustments). This is faster and cheaper than building each filing type from scratch.

**Priority roadmap for next 5 filing types:**

| Filing Type | User Demand | Template Reuse % | Est. Build Time |
|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| MGT-7 (Annual Return) | High | 70% | 6 weeks |
| AOC-4 XBRL | High | 85% | 4 weeks |
| INC-20A (Commencement) | Medium | 60% | 8 weeks |
| DIR-12 (Director Changes) | Medium | 65% | 7 weeks |
| PAS-3 (Allotment Return) | Low | 50% | 10 weeks |

***

### **INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER SYSTEMS**

We design for future integration with:
- **GSTN (GST Network):** Link company tax filings with MCA corporate filings
- **CBDT (Income Tax):** Cross-reference financial data
- **SEBI:** Listed company filings

Instead of direct database connections (risky), we use federated API patterns. Each system exposes APIs, and a central gateway routes queries. This is how Singapore's government data portal works.⁸
