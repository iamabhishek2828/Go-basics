You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. Your manager wanted:
1. **Narrative format** (max 3-4 pages)
2. **Good citations**
3. **Complete scope approach**
4. **Innovative methods** that differentiate from competition

But then when you asked for tabular format, I should have created **ONE comprehensive table** instead of 4 separate ones.

Here's the **SINGLE MASTER TABLE** that covers all your manager's requirements:
