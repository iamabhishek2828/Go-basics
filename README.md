| **Brazil — GRAS (Governance Risk Assessment System)**             | Public procurement was losing large sums to collusion and hidden fraud that normal checks could not find, draining funds from services.                   | GRAS collects procurement records and related datasets, applies many risk checks, and produces a ranked list of suspicious suppliers and contracts so auditors investigate the highest-risk cases first rather than scanning everything by hand. | GRAS pilots identified hundreds–thousands of suspect entities (reports cite ~850+ suspicious suppliers, 450+ strawmen, 500+ conflict-of-interest cases and several thousand politically linked firms) and made fraud detection roughly **3× faster** than manual methods.                                    | World Bank GRAS / case notes: [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/841d9990-8f7e-4860-9acd-cba1b9f096a3](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/841d9990-8f7e-4860-9acd-cba1b9f096a3) ; GRAS summary: [https://www.govtransparency.eu/governance-risk-assessment-system-gras-advanced-data-analytics-for-detecting-fraud-corruption-and-collusion-in-public-expenditures/](https://www.govtransparency.eu/governance-risk-assessment-system-gras-advanced-data-analytics-for-detecting-fraud-corruption-and-collusion-in-public-expenditures/) |
