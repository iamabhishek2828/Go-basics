Great — I matched your manager’s simple style and continued the recommendations after **H**. Each item is one short, manager-ready sentence and includes an authoritative source in the same bracketed style your manager used. Pasteable as-is.

I. **Governance & Programme Board**
Create an IFMS 2.0 Programme Board (Finance Secretary + AG rep + NIC SIO + 2 line-dept HoDs) to approve scope, monitor KPIs and resolve policy/process blockers. ([IMF][1]). ([IMF][1])

J. **Master-data & Migration Sprint**
Run a 6-week master-data clean-up sprint (GL, vendors, employees, banks) with automated de-duplication and cross-system matching before go-live. ([CAG CTOS IT Audit][2]). ([Comptroller and Auditor General of India][2])

K. **Phased Pilot + Parallel Run**
Pilot IFMS 2.0 in one department (P2P → payment → bank-reco) for 2–3 months in parallel with CTOS to validate interfaces and processes before statewide rollout. ([World Bank FMIS guidance][3]). ([World Bank][3])

L. **Capacity Building & Helpdesk/COE**
Budget 12 months of operational support, a central FMIS helpdesk/COE, and regular training (in-person + LMS) to sustain operations and reduce dependence on external vendors. ([NITI Tripura fiscal review][4]). ([Niti Aayog][4])

M. **KPIs, Audit Hooks & Monthly Reviews**
Publish a compact KPI set (daily cash, outstanding UCs, payment lag, bank-reco rate) and require monthly Programme Board review; add immutable audit exports for AG. ([IMF + CAG recommendations][1][2]). ([IMF][1])

N. **Security, Resilience & Access Governance**
Implement RBAC, SoD matrices, periodic access recertification, parameter change logs and a disaster-recovery plan (RTO/RPO) before production. ([IMF digital-PFM guidance][1]). ([IMF][1])

O. **Open Data & Public Finance Portal**
Publish a simple public portal with live budget vs. spend and scheme-level releases to improve transparency and supplier accountability. (World Bank / FMIS transparency lessons). ([World Bank][3])

If you want, I can:
• convert these into the exact one-line format your manager used (with the same small-font footnote links), or
• produce a one-page slide/PDF with these bullets + the reference footnotes for handing to your manager.

Which would you like me to produce now?
