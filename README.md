# MCA CDM Evaluation: Complete Scope Approach with Competitive Innovations

**Prepared for:** Ministry of Corporate Affairs | **November 2025** | **PwC India**

---

## Executive summary

The Corporate Data Management (CDM) Scheme was launched in FY 2015–16 to transform MCA21 from a transactional filing platform into a strategic national data asset covering filings from over 1.4 million companies. This brief proposes a compact, deliverable-focused evaluation and implementation approach that meets the RFP scope while embedding a CBSE-aligned budget discipline and practical innovations that set PwC apart. The objective is to deliver an early proof-of-value (POV), a governance and compliance package, and a scalable monetization roadmap that moves CDM toward self-sustainability within 24–36 months. Key promises: early demonstration of value, measurable quality improvements, robust legal controls, and a productized data marketplace road‑map. [2][6][15]

## 1. Purpose and high-level objectives

This evaluation will answer three priority questions for MCA: (a) can CDM reliably convert filings into accurate, usable data for policy and enforcement; (b) what technical, operational and governance gaps block scale or monetization; and (c) what phased, budget-aware programme will rapidly deliver value and make CDM sustainable. Objectives include an operational diagnostic, a working POV pipeline and dashboard, a governance and legal package (including DPIA), and a CBSE-aligned budget and monetization plan. [2][4][8]

## 2. Narrative methodology — how we will work (paragraph format)

Our approach is anchored in evidence-based analysis, iterative validation, and risk-controlled implementation. The focus is on developing a clear understanding of the Corporate Data Management (CDM) system, identifying improvement opportunities, and aligning all recommendations with CBSE-style risk management and governance principles. [1][12][16]

We begin with data discovery and stakeholder mapping, assessing the structure, volume, and quality of existing filings (such as PDFs, XMLs, and Excel formats). This stage helps identify the most critical datasets, their dependencies, and compliance sensitivities. [4][5][6]

Next, we adopt an evidence-driven diagnostic to uncover inefficiencies in extraction, transformation, and metadata enrichment processes. Our analysis also evaluates control maturity—masking, access rights, lineage, and monitoring—using DPDP and NDSAP frameworks as references. [8][14][16]

The core methodology applies agile and design-thinking principles: small, testable experiments to validate hypotheses before scale. Each iteration focuses on impact validation (e.g., time saved, quality improved, or policy utility enhanced) rather than broad technical rollout. [11][16]

Parallel to technical assessment, we ensure legal and operational compliance through a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), privacy risk mapping, and access-tier definition for public, research, and commercial use. [8][9][14]

Finally, findings are translated into a scalable roadmap — covering process recommendations, data governance improvements, and monetization opportunities — all aligned with CBSE financial discipline and risk-control norms. [1][9][12][13]

## 3. Innovations that set us apart (paragraphs with evidence)

PwC’s approach combines practical engineering with targeted innovations to reduce time-to-value and total cost while improving accuracy and trust. First, we use a **hybrid parser + human-in-the-loop** model: ML-enabled document parsing handles the high-volume, repetitive structure while a lightweight QC workflow resolves ambiguous cases. This reduces manual effort quickly without sacrificing accuracy—a pragmatic approach validated in comparable government implementations. [4][19]

Second, **active learning** focuses human labeling only where models are uncertain, lowering annotation costs and speeding model improvement. Third, **graph-based entity resolution** connects company filings across years and linked entities, enabling robust misreporting detection and richer macro analytics. Fourth, **privacy-preserving analytics** (aggregation, masking, and where needed, synthetic datasets) allow monetization while protecting personal data and complying with DPDP. Finally, we build a **data product factory**—a standardized pipeline to package, score and publish data products (raw extracts, aggregated reports, APIs, dashboards) in weeks, not months—accelerating monetization trials and market feedback. These methods are pragmatic, low-risk, and designed to be piloted quickly. [11][13][14]

## 4. Practical examples & use-cases (short paragraphs)

Policy: Rapid GVA/GDP recalculation using cleaned financial filings and sectoral aggregations will materially reduce the lag in national indicators — for example, we aim to **reduce GVA/GDP calculation lag from ~6 months to ~2 months**, enabling timelier policy interventions and fiscal planning. Enforcement: Predictive fraud scoring surfaces anomalous filings for regulator review; our target is to **reduce case triage time by 50%**, so regulators can prioritise high-risk matters faster and reallocate enforcement resources. Research: Curated historic datasets and rich metadata access will be provided to researchers — target: **access to 10+ years of longitudinal company-level data** (cleaned and documented) to support trend analysis and academic studies. Commercial: Pay-per-call APIs and subscription dashboards provide developers and consultancies with ready analytics for market-intelligence products. Each product is scored for legal risk, data quality and market potential before release. [4][6][9]

## 5. CBSE-aligned budget and KPIs (compact table)

| Category                | Allocation (%) | Purpose & outcome                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure          |             35 | Data warehouse, cloud compute, API gateways — foundation for scale and reliability.          |
| Human resources         |             25 | Training, capacity building and expert support to ensure knowledge transfer and sustainment. |
| Operations              |             20 | ETL runs, quality checks, support, and stakeholder engagement.                               |
| R&D / pilots            |             15 | Product factory experiments, pricing pilots and innovation.                                  |
| Compliance & governance |              5 | DPIA, legal reviews, audits and documentation.                                               |

Key KPIs: extraction coverage for priority forms; data quality pass rate; median API response time; time-to-fulfil standard requests; pilot monetization revenue and stakeholder satisfaction. These KPIs map directly to CBSE value-for-money monitoring. [7][11]

## 6. Risk controls & mitigation (brief)

We operationalise a control catalogue mapped to NIST/ISO techniques and CBSE accountability: data quality controls (profiling, lineage, recon), privacy controls (PII discovery, masking, DPIA), operational controls (incremental loads, retry logic, DR), and governance controls (access provisioning, SLA management). Each control has an owner, evidence artifact and testing cadence. Budgeted contingency and a phased approach reduce both technical and legal risk before monetization. [8][12][14]

## 7. Delivery timeline (Gantt-linked summary)

A concise, Gantt-linked summary of the delivery timeline is provided here; a detailed Gantt chart with week-by-week activities, milestones and dependencies is attached as Annex A. Total programme duration for the evaluation and initial rollout is expected to be **~26–30 weeks (6–7 months)**, with overlapping workstreams for diagnostics, build, and controls.

Key milestones (high level):

* **Week 0–2:** Project charter sign-off, stakeholder approvals and sample data access.
* **Week 3–6:** Rapid diagnostic, stakeholder prioritisation and selection of POV forms.
* **Week 7–12:** POV deployment (ingest → transform → dashboard/API) and process mapping.
* **Week 8–14 (parallel):** DPIA, legal mapping, and governance handbook preparation.
* **Week 13–26:** Scale roadmap execution, historical data onboarding (phased), product pilots and monetization experiments.
* **Week 24–30:** Final handover, SOPs, training and operational acceptance.

This compressed textual summary complements the Gantt chart (Annex A). Use the chart for detailed sequencing, resource assignments and inter‑task dependencies; use this paragraph for the evaluator-facing narrative of what each phase achieves.

## 8. Why this wins (short paragraph)

This approach balances speed, cost discipline, and risk control. The hybrid technology + human workflow delivers practical accuracy fast; the product-focused monetization route creates measurable revenue trials; and CBSE-aligned budgeting makes the programme accountable to public financial norms. PwC’s blend of delivery rigour and pragmatic innovations—active learning, graph resolution, data product factory and privacy-preserving analytics—creates competitive differentiation while remaining fully compliant with national policy and procurement expectations.
