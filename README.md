Got it üëç ‚Äî your manager said Options **1, 2, and 3** (Ask & Get Exact Answers, Doc-aware Advisor, and Smart Search & Fraud Flag) were overlapping, so you want a **better, consolidated version** of this table with **4 improved, distinct options** that don‚Äôt feel repetitive.

Here‚Äôs a refined and clearer version:

### üîπ Improved Table ‚Äì ‚ÄúTalk to Data in PFM‚Äù Options

| **Option**                      | **How it works (simple)**                                                                                                                           | **What it helps with**                                                                                                                    | **What data it uses**                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1) Smart Insights Assistant** | You ask a question (text/voice) and the app analyzes your transactions and policies to give a clear, sourced answer with quick insights or visuals. | Quick, accurate insights ‚Äî e.g., ‚ÄúHow much did I spend on travel last month?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs this charge refundable?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúShow my spending trend.‚Äù | Transactions (date, amount, merchant), balances, and policy documents.    |
| **2) Spending & Fraud Monitor** | The app auto-scans your data to identify spending patterns, detect duplicate or suspicious transactions, and flag potential frauds in real time.    | Detects errors, recurring payments, or unusual activity ‚Äî ensures financial safety and accuracy.                                          | Transaction details, merchant data, timestamps, and device/location info. |
| **3) Goal & Budget Coach**      | You set goals or budgets (like ‚ÄúSave ‚Çπ5000 this month‚Äù), and the app tracks progress, suggests adjustments, and nudges you when off-track.          | Personalized coaching for savings, budgeting, and smarter money habits.                                                                   | Budgets, income/expense data, and saving targets.                         |
| **4) Voice-Enabled Actions**    | Speak a command (‚ÄúTransfer ‚Çπ2000 to savings‚Äù), and the app confirms securely with OTP before completing the task.                                   | Hands-free experience ‚Äî quick fund transfers, bill payments, or goal updates with verification.                                           | Transactions, account IDs, available balance, and consent/auth logs.      |

Would you like me to make this version sound a bit more **formal and presentation-ready** (e.g., for a slide or report)?

Great ‚Äî I matched your manager‚Äôs simple style and continued the recommendations after **H**. Each item is one short, manager-ready sentence and includes an authoritative source in the same bracketed style your manager used. Pasteable as-is.

I. **Governance & Programme Board**
Create an IFMS 2.0 Programme Board (Finance Secretary + AG rep + NIC SIO + 2 line-dept HoDs) to approve scope, monitor KPIs and resolve policy/process blockers. ([IMF][1]). ([IMF][1])

J. **Master-data & Migration Sprint**
Run a 6-week master-data clean-up sprint (GL, vendors, employees, banks) with automated de-duplication and cross-system matching before go-live. ([CAG CTOS IT Audit][2]). ([Comptroller and Auditor General of India][2])

K. **Phased Pilot + Parallel Run**
Pilot IFMS 2.0 in one department (P2P ‚Üí payment ‚Üí bank-reco) for 2‚Äì3 months in parallel with CTOS to validate interfaces and processes before statewide rollout. ([World Bank FMIS guidance][3]). ([World Bank][3])

L. **Capacity Building & Helpdesk/COE**
Budget 12 months of operational support, a central FMIS helpdesk/COE, and regular training (in-person + LMS) to sustain operations and reduce dependence on external vendors. ([NITI Tripura fiscal review][4]). ([Niti Aayog][4])

M. **KPIs, Audit Hooks & Monthly Reviews**
Publish a compact KPI set (daily cash, outstanding UCs, payment lag, bank-reco rate) and require monthly Programme Board review; add immutable audit exports for AG. ([IMF + CAG recommendations][1][2]). ([IMF][1])

N. **Security, Resilience & Access Governance**
Implement RBAC, SoD matrices, periodic access recertification, parameter change logs and a disaster-recovery plan (RTO/RPO) before production. ([IMF digital-PFM guidance][1]). ([IMF][1])

If you want, I can:
‚Ä¢ convert these into the exact one-line format your manager used (with the same small-font footnote links), or
‚Ä¢ produce a one-page slide/PDF with these bullets + the reference footnotes for handing to your manager.

Which would you like me to produce now?
