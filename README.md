Dear Mr. Mukund (and Anupriya),

Thank you for your frank feedback. I fully understand that any further extension must be backed by clear, tangible outputs. Below is a consolidated list of the contributions I have completed or am actively working on, all of which I can demonstrate immediately:
Below is your updated consolidated list with the **Pension Bot** bullet rewritten to include the new point (polished and ready to paste):

* **PoC — Risk-Based Approach for Financial Management Process (CBSE)**
  *Status:* In progress and demonstrable. I have contributed to the PoC design and integrated risk-based checkpoints into the PFM workflow.

* **Talk-to-Data Integration in PFM (CBSE Context)**
  *Status:* Implemented. I have integrated the Talk-to-Data capability into the PFM system using CBSE datasets and can showcase the interaction end-to-end.

* **PoC — Treasury Risk Management**
  *Status:* Draft completed with technical flows and initial test scenarios.

* **A&M**
  *Status:* Contributing to the design inputs and implementation for emerging technologies covering new AI/ML capabilities.

* **Pension Bot for Rajasthan (Development & Deployment)**
  *Status:* Fully developed and deployed by me. The bot is production-ready and re-usable across projects to simplify pension workflows and automate information retrieval. It was implemented using and cross-verified with official Rajasthan government documentation (supported by the government site). Demo/hosted app: [https://pension-assistant.vercel.app/](https://pension-assistant.vercel.app/)

In addition to the above work, I want to highlight that with my AI/ML and full-stack development skills, I can contribute significantly more on the technical side if given further opportunity. I am also actively learning more about the PFM domain, which will help me deliver deeper and more relevant contributions aligned with project needs.

Would you like this inserted into the full email draft to Shashi & Anupriya?
