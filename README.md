| **1. Identify (Flag Candidates)**                | Inputs: payment ledgers, supplier master, contracts. Processing: normalize fields, apply rules (duplicate invoice, missing approval, unusual bank account). Outputs: daily candidate list with reasons and evidence pointers. | Produces a daily suspect list auditors can act on quickly; uses OCR to index contracts and a rule engine to flag exceptions (optional RAG search). | **Brazil (GRAS):** flagged **850+ suspicious suppliers** and made fraud detection **3× faster** than manual review.        | System screens 100% of sample transactions and produces candidate CSV with rule-based flags. |
| **2. Prioritise (Score & Rank)**                 | Inputs: candidate list. Processing: apply severity scoring (rule breaches weighted high, frequency/amount added). Outputs: ranked worklist with plain-language rationale.                                                     | Converts candidates into a ranked worklist so auditors focus on highest-value items; uses explainable scoring (JSON weights) and optional ML.      | **UK (DWP ML):** prioritisation of welfare fraud cases saved **£1.3bn** in one year and blocked **£18bn** potential fraud. | Top 100 risks ranked by severity with rationale; 70% of top-50 confirmed on review.          |
| **3. Prevent & Mitigate (Pre-Payment Controls)** | Inputs: high-certainty flags. Processing: auto-hold, escalate, or request evidence with human gatekeeping. Outputs: held payments log + notification to approvers.                                                            | Prevents obvious breaches while keeping humans in control; integrates holds into payment flows via workflow automation and secure APIs.            | **Kazakhstan Treasury:** COSO-style embedded checks stopped **US$2.7bn** improper payments in 2022.                        | At least 5 true rule-based holds executed and resolved through controlled workflow.          |
| **4. Evidence Packs (Support Fast Review)**      | Inputs: flagged cases. Processing: auto-bundle contract pages, invoice scans, and triggered rule text. Outputs: downloadable evidence pack for each item.                                                                     | Builds a single, auditable file per case (exact contract page + invoice + rule excerpt) so reviewers validate quickly (PDF anchoring/viewer).      | **Estonia:** e-invoicing reforms produced **tamper-proof digital trails** and cut reconciliation time significantly.       | Evidence packs for top 20 flagged items reviewable in <10 mins each.                         |
| **5. Human Review & Disposition**                | Inputs: evidence packs. Processing: auditors validate, label (true issue/false positive), and add notes. Outputs: disposition log + labeled dataset for tuning.                                                               | Simple one-click disposition workflow that creates labelled data for tuning; uses annotation UI and an active-learning loop.                       | **Singapore:** continuous payroll audit covered **90,000 workers + 34,000 pensioners** with near-zero payment errors.      | ≥70% of top-50 flags validated as true/further action; full audit trail of reviewer notes.   |
| **6. Monitor & Report (Dashboards)**             | Inputs: resolved outcomes + KPIs. Processing: daily/weekly aggregation. Outputs: dashboards, risk heatmaps, exception trend reports.                                                                                          | Executive dashboards and one-pagers show trends and KPIs; BI tools + auto-narrative generation provide clear, exportable summaries.                | **Jacksonville, USA:** Power BI dashboards saved **600+ staff hours** annually and improved public transparency.           | Executive dashboard live within 24h of data load; exportable 1-page risk report.             |
| **7. Learn & Tune (Continuous Governance)**      | Inputs: reviewer outcomes + logs. Processing: adjust thresholds, retrain light scoring models, version rule registry. Outputs: updated rules/models with audit trail.                                                         | Weekly/periodic tuning uses labelled outcomes to reduce false positives; maintain a versioned rule/model registry and approval workflow.           | **Czech Republic:** regulatory AI pilots cut regulation search from **days to minutes** via iterative user feedback.       | Weekly rule tuning with change log; approval required for every new rule.                    |
