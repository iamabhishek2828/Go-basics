Now I'll create a comprehensive document showing the methodology and approach for implementing the CDM evaluation with CBSE context, proper sources, and examples.

# Methodology and Implementation Framework for Corporate Data Management (CDM) Scheme Evaluation

## Executive Summary



The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Corporate Data Management (CDM) scheme aims to turn MCA21 filings into a structured, usable data asset and to make CDM sustainable and useful for government, research and industry. This document defines a pragmatic evaluation and delivery approach that (a) assesses current capability, (b) delivers a small working proof-of-value quickly, and (c) lays out a roadmap to scale, monetize, govern and sustain CDM operations. Key outcomes: an operational diagnostic, a POC pipeline and dashboards, governance and monetization strategy, and a control-based risk plan aligned to central budget/priorities (CBSE context).
