This Proof of Concept (PoC) is designed to identify, prioritise and mitigate risks across all financial disbursement and procurement processes. It demonstrates how an AI-enabled Financial Reporting and Risk Management System can pre-emptively detect high-certainty irregularities through rules-based and analytical checks supported by essential human oversight. The system compiles auditable evidence packs for each flagged case enabling rapid validation by auditors and continuously refines its accuracy through reviewer feedback. All operations are run on secure, sovereign infrastructure with strong governance ensuring transparency, compliance and accountability aligned with donor and public-sector standards.
