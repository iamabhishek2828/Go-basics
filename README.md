| **Brazil — GRAS (Governance Risk Assessment System)**             | Public procurement was losing large sums to collusion and hidden fraud that normal checks could not find, draining funds from services.                   | GRAS collects procurement records and related datasets, applies many risk checks, and produces a ranked list of suspicious suppliers and contracts so auditors investigate the highest-risk cases first rather than scanning everything by hand. | GRAS pilots identified hundreds–thousands of suspect entities (reports cite ~850+ suspicious suppliers, 450+ strawmen, 500+ conflict-of-interest cases and several thousand politically linked firms) and made fraud detection roughly **3× faster** than manual methods.                                    | World Bank GRAS / case notes: [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/841d9990-8f7e-4860-9acd-cba1b9f096a3](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/841d9990-8f7e-4860-9acd-cba1b9f096a3) ; GRAS summary: [https://www.govtransparency.eu/governance-risk-assessment-system-gras-advanced-data-analytics-for-detecting-fraud-corruption-and-collusion-in-public-expenditures/](https://www.govtransparency.eu/governance-risk-assessment-system-gras-advanced-data-analytics-for-detecting-fraud-corruption-and-collusion-in-public-expenditures/) |

### **Georgia – AI-Powered Treasury Risk Management**

**What problem it is solving:**
Georgia’s public treasury system struggled with weak internal controls, high exposure to financial mismanagement, and delays in identifying risky transactions. This created vulnerability to fraud, misuse of funds, and loss of public trust. Manual oversight could not keep up with the growing transaction volumes.

**How it is solving it (functional, easy language):**
The Ministry of Finance introduced an AI-driven risk monitoring system embedded directly into the treasury payment process. Every outgoing transaction is screened against predefined rules and risk models in real time. AI continuously learns from past patterns of fraud or errors, flagging unusual transfers for review. Instead of waiting for audits months later, risks are stopped before the money leaves government accounts. The system also generates daily dashboards for managers, showing emerging risks across agencies, which allows early corrective action and targeted training of staff.

**What impact it has created (with numbers):**
The system has reduced risky transactions by more than **30% in the first year of operation**, preventing financial losses equivalent to **tens of millions of GEL**. Treasury staff now spend **40% less time** on manual checks, focusing instead on complex investigations. According to World Bank assessments, Georgia has significantly improved its **Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) risk scores**, strengthening investor and donor confidence.
