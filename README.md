Example: run 6â€“10 high-value checks (missing approval; duplicate invoice number; amount > policy threshold; repeated payments to same vendor; supplier on blacklist), attach page-level document links and a one-line reason for each flag, and export a candidate list for Audit Triage.
Converts flagged transactions into a prioritized worklist so auditors focus on the most significant risks first. Prioritization is based on key factors such as the severity of the breach (e.g., missing approvals, threshold breaches), financial exposure, and frequency or recurrence of similar patterns. The system uses a transparent, explainable scoring logic that can be enhanced with light machine learning to adapt over time based on auditor feedback. This ensures critical cases are addressed promptly while lower-risk items are queued for later review.
